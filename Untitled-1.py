#WHILE LOOPS 

#x = 0
#while x <=5: #when X is greater than 5 the loop stops
#    print(x)
#    x = x + 1 #Used to increment by 1!! 

#count = 7
#while count < 1:
#    print("Hello World")

#FOR LOOPS 

# for loops iterate, or run through, a program a specific number of times before it stops. 
# A for loop can be written like if and if-else statements. Hereâ€™s the general format:
#   for item in [items]:
#       statement 1
#       statement 2

# In if loops, one can use the function: range() to simplify code. It creates an iterable object or a list.  
# For example, if we had a list of numbers, we could print each number using a for loop
# for num in range(5):
 #   print(num)
#       OR 
# numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# for num in numbers:
#    print(num)
